    <h4>Induction heating coils are our specialty</h4>

      <p>Fairview Coil Fabrication (FCF) specializes in the design and manufacture 
         of high quality copper induction coils. The induction heating coil is a vital 
         component of RF induction heating systems that are used for industrial brazing, 
         soldering, heat treating and other metalworking applications.</p>

    <h4>Coil Fabrication</h4>

      <p>We have years of experience with induction coil design and fabrication. 
         We can manufacture top quality copper coils from your drawings and 
         specifications. Or, if you're investigating a new application, we'll 
         work with you to determine the optimum coil design for your parts and 
         process. A high-efficiency coil heating coil design will pay for itself 
         many times over in energy savings, and reduce the overall investment 
         required for the power supply.</p>
